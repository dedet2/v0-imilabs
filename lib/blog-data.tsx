    content: [
      "The EU AI Act represents the most comprehensive AI regulation globally, and 2026 marks a critical year for compliance. Organizations deploying AI systems in the European Union must understand their obligations and take proactive steps to ensure compliance. This landmark legislation will fundamentally reshape how businesses develop, deploy, and maintain artificial intelligence systems across all sectors.",
      "As someone who has spent over two decades at the intersection of technology and policy, I've watched this regulation evolve from early proposals to the comprehensive framework we see today. The Act didn't emerge in a vacuum—it's the culmination of years of growing concern about AI's impact on fundamental rights, safety, and democratic values.",
      "Understanding the Risk-Based Approach: The Act categorizes AI systems into four distinct risk levels, each with different compliance obligations. Unacceptable risk systems are outright banned—these include social scoring systems, real-time biometric identification in public spaces (with limited exceptions), and AI that manipulates human behavior to circumvent free will. High-risk systems face the most stringent requirements and include AI used in critical infrastructure, education, employment, essential services, law enforcement, and border management.",
      "Limited risk systems, such as chatbots and deepfakes, must meet transparency requirements—users must be informed they're interacting with AI. Minimal risk systems, which constitute the vast majority of AI applications, face no specific regulatory requirements under the Act, though general principles of responsible AI development still apply.",
      "Key Compliance Requirements for High-Risk Systems: Organizations deploying high-risk AI must implement comprehensive risk management systems that identify, analyze, evaluate, and mitigate risks throughout the AI lifecycle. This isn't a one-time assessment—it requires ongoing monitoring and updates as the system evolves and new risks emerge.",
      "Technical documentation requirements are extensive. You must maintain detailed records of the system's purpose, design specifications, training methodologies, data governance practices, and performance metrics. This documentation must be sufficient for authorities to assess compliance and must be updated whenever significant changes occur.",
      "Data governance is particularly critical. The Act requires that training, validation, and testing datasets be relevant, representative, and free from errors. For high-risk systems, you must implement measures to examine potential biases and ensure data quality. This is where many organizations struggle—historical data often encodes past discrimination, and addressing this requires intentional intervention.",
      "Human oversight requirements ensure that AI systems can be effectively supervised by humans. This includes implementing 'stop' buttons, designing systems so humans can understand their outputs, and ensuring operators are trained to identify anomalies and potential risks.",
      "Timeline and Penalties: The Act's provisions are being phased in over several years. Prohibitions on unacceptable-risk AI took effect in early 2025. Requirements for general-purpose AI models became applicable in August 2025. High-risk system requirements will be fully enforceable by August 2026, making this year critical for compliance preparation.",
      "Penalties for non-compliance are severe: up to €35 million or 7% of global annual turnover for violations related to prohibited AI practices; up to €15 million or 3% for other violations. For many organizations, these penalties could be existential. But beyond financial penalties, non-compliance risks reputational damage, loss of market access, and exclusion from an increasingly ethics-conscious supply chain.",
      "Strategic Recommendations: Begin with a comprehensive AI inventory. Many organizations are surprised to discover how many AI systems they actually deploy—from obvious applications like recommendation engines to less visible uses in HR screening, fraud detection, and customer service. Every system needs classification and potential compliance assessment.",
      "Establish cross-functional governance structures now. AI compliance isn't just a technical problem—it requires coordination between legal, compliance, engineering, data science, and business teams. Create clear lines of responsibility and decision-making authority before regulatory pressure intensifies.",
      "Invest in documentation infrastructure. The Act's requirements for technical documentation, logging, and record-keeping are substantial. Organizations that build these capabilities now will be better positioned for compliance and will also benefit from improved operational visibility and debugging capabilities.",
      "The organizations that thrive under the EU AI Act will be those that view compliance not as a burden but as an opportunity to build trust, differentiate from competitors, and create AI systems that genuinely serve human flourishing. The regulatory landscape is shifting—the question is whether your organization will lead or follow.",

      "Data collection and curation represent critical junctures where bias can be introduced or mitigated. Teams must carefully consider whose data is included, whose is excluded, and what historical inequities might be encoded in training datasets.",
      "Testing and validation must go beyond traditional metrics to include fairness evaluations across different demographic groups. This includes testing for disparate impact, examining edge cases, and engaging affected communities in the evaluation process.",
      "Inclusive design also means considering accessibility from the outset. AI interfaces should be usable by people with disabilities, and AI systems should not create new barriers to access or participation.",
      "Finally, inclusive AI requires ongoing monitoring and accountability mechanisms. Organizations must be prepared to identify and address harms that emerge after deployment, with clear channels for affected individuals to report concerns.",

      "Detection begins with understanding the multiple forms bias can take: historical bias embedded in training data, representation bias from non-representative samples, measurement bias from flawed proxies, and algorithmic bias introduced during model development.",
      "Technical approaches to bias detection include statistical parity analysis, examining outcomes across protected groups, and using interpretability tools to understand how models make decisions.",
      "Mitigation strategies can be applied at different stages: pre-processing techniques that balance or transform training data, in-processing methods that constrain learning algorithms, and post-processing adjustments to model outputs.",
      "However, technical solutions alone are insufficient. Organizations must also address the organizational and societal factors that contribute to biased AI, including lack of diversity in AI teams and insufficient engagement with affected communities.",

For those who may be unfamiliar with smart lock systems, they are a relatively new technological advancement that uses image and facial recognition software to enable users entry to businesses and residences thereby eliminating physical keys; this technology is believed to increase safety and ease of accessibility.",
      "No more misplaced and lost keys, costly locksmith services, and the ease of allowing temporary and/or limited access to vendors, guests, and service providers. These are the pros and admittedly, they are cost-efficient, time-saving, and an added convenience for some – perhaps, many.",
      "There is a misconception that AI is godlike, infallible even; but AI is a product of wholly fallible human design. Coded into the complex algorithms are the same biases we deal with in our day to day human experiences. Laypersons are more apt to buy into a science they don't fully understand and this leaves an already over-policed, vulnerable faction of the population at a heightened risk of unprecedented, unmitigated harm.",

The call-in is the seed from which the best accessible, equitable, and inclusive products and processes take shape. Who am I designing this for? Who am I designing it with? If they are not one and the same, we must go back and begin again. This work is slow, iterative, and intentional, but necessary for radical change.",
      "The second is more of a guiding principle, 'Design for one, extend to many.' This principle from my friend and mentor, Kat Holmes is another essential tool in designing accessibly and equitably. When we design anything with the most marginalized and underrepresented, (deliberately and not) among us at the forefront of our design process, we are in essence extending that ease and accessibility to the masses.",
      "As more and more citizens increase their literacy and awareness around personally identifying data/biometric data collection it stands to reason that we are all looking for ways to protect ourselves. In the way that capitalism is often both the cause and cure, designers are stepping up to fulfill that need; but at what cost?",
      "I've written about hyper-reliance on facial recognition technology and the added layer of harm it causes for the oft-misidentified BIPOC and LGBTQ+ communities, so when adversarial clothing brands started to emerge, my interests were piqued and as it turns out, I wasn't alone.",

This participation occurs without consent, or even awareness, and is bolstered by a lack of legislative oversight. More disturbingly, however, the current implementation of these technologies involves significant racial bias, particularly against Black Americans.'</em> — <a href='https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2020/racial-discrimination-in-face-recognition-technology/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>harvard.edu</a>",

      "For Parks, who was accused of the more serious crimes of assault and eluding the police, the fight to clear his name went on for the better part of a year. Before his case was thrown out of court, and his name cleared, Parks would go on to spend 10 days in jail all due to hyper-reliance on technology. In a later filed lawsuit against the Woodbridge Police Department, its affiliates, and Idemia; the company behind the facial recognition software, Parks alleged that proper investigative techniques were forgone in lieu of reliance on the faulty technology.",
      "Despite widely published research findings detailing the issues of misidentification of darker skinned faces by facial recognition technologies, law enforcement's hyper-reliance remains. For BIPOC, and most notably, dark-skinned Black women (for whom misidentification occurs as often as 33% of the time compared to that of white men) this adds an added layer of concern.",

The ACLU found that false matches came back for 28 lawmakers when compared against 25,000 mugshot photos. These false match rates were disproportionately high for people of color—and this was testing against some of the most photographed faces in America.",

When you use that reaction GIF of a Black person making an exaggerated expression, you're participating in a digital form of minstrelsy.

      "It is this difference that makes it 'funny', when a white person uses the popular Nene Leakes meme, 'I said what I said' it frames her posturing, verbiage, and appearance as a joke, devaluing the significance and cultural relevance of her use of AAVE or the oft-animated and emotive style of communication between some Black women and their close friends and family.",

      "Being mindful about the images we share online is part of building a more equitable digital culture. It requires us to think critically about whose images we're using, in what context, and whether our usage perpetuates harmful stereotypes.

      "Designing for liberation takes the conversation a step further with a perspective shift that, albeit non-linear, seeks to establish from inception, a table that is not only built for, but with those who would have otherwise faced obstacles and inequities which hinder their access, or who have may have been altogether excluded for reasons beyond their control.",

Yet, these are the very things we can no longer ignore.",
      "In her critique of Design Thinking, Anaissie carefully and compassionately called out a series of missed opportunities to curtail harm and/or power inequities at the design level. One of which is the popular e-cigarette brand, Juul. If you are not familiar with the company, Juul is a brand leader in e-cigarette products, or vaporizers designed to help adults quit smoking.",

      "From the design thinking perspective of designing for 'social change', Juul's designers, 'two alumni of a renowned Silicon Valley design program' checked all of the right boxes. However, in designing a product to 'limit the offensiveness of traditional smoking for both the smoker and those around them,' they missed an integral segment of the population: teens.",
      "According to <a href='https://truthinitiative.org/research-resources/emerging-tobacco-products/what-juul' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>the truth initiative</a>, 'The popularity of JUUL among youth has helped the product account for 73 percent of e-cigarette sales in the U.S., as of September 2018. Many are attributing the product's rise to its sleek design that could be mistaken for a flash drive — which makes it easy to disguise and use discreetly — and availability of youth-appealing flavors.'",
      "By not designing with attention to the highly addictive nature of nicotine and the understanding and awareness of the allure of a new and trendy, covert means of accessing nicotine for teens, or how the tobacco industry has long targeted and disproportionately affected 'people in low-income communities, racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ individuals, women, youth, members of the military and those with mental illness...' they perpetuated further harm by contributing to a <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>public health crisis</a>.",

The dangers of the myriad intersectional biases in tech design have made their way from the confines of esoteric spaces into broader mainstream discussions of diversity, equity, inclusion, and ethics.",
      "Although many big tech companies are hiring in-house DEI consultants and broaching the topic of more equitable AI, those who share lived experiences of marginalization and deliberate, systemic underrepresentation and oppression across (but not limited to) the intersections of race and gender remain–in most cases–deliberately, and certainly systemically—marginalized and underrepresented. This is an insidious dynamic that, although veiled by the perceived objectivity of science, continues to cause harm.",

      "I was only five years old the first time I mentally code switched and went into another person's experience. My father was never able to handle the pain caused by the sickle cell anemia I was born with, and it was in the throes of a painful sickle cell crisis that I learned he couldn't cope with hospitals. Children are very perceptive to their parents' emotions, and in that moment I could feel his terror and helplessness pulsing within me as if it were my own. During that experience I decided that I had to be strong for the both of us. I was too young to manage all of my pain, my fear, and his anxiety; so, I minimized the agony in my body in order to diminish his panic. In doing so, we would all be okay.",
      "Little did I know that this skill of diminishing myself would become an asset when I moved from Togo to America, where there is a strong societal standard for making other people comfortable. As a child, I internalized that being a good American citizen meant never getting into trouble, never asking for too much, never being ungrateful, and the list didn't stop there, despite how doing so sometimes endangered my life.",
      "As I progressed through schooling and professional life, the messaging included working twice as hard to prove I deserved to be here, and staying invisible so that my struggles would never burden anyone else or, more importantly, never interrupt the narrative of pure meritocracy. To this day, I disappear in order to manage other people's feelings and the world around me.",
      "My body takes on other people's fears, scrutiny, biases, and rejection. At 5 feet, 6 inches, I've been taught that my body will be taken as imposing or threatening, so I never wear heels. My posture suffers from trying to shrink myself into an acceptable form. Despite these undue expectations, I found ways to assert myself in my youth because this is the only body I have, and it refuses to be washed out. (I became a goth in high school to reclaim my sense of self. With all the makeup and clothing, it ensured I'd go unnoticed while also masking my race and gender.)",
      "<strong>Invisibility became a requisite for success.</strong>",
      "The only way I could get work done, let alone advance in the tech industry, was to ensure no one was bothered by my differences, that I wasn't seen as an agitator, as difficult to work with, as overly questioning, or disrespectful to authority. To put it more bluntly, I learned to stay in my place. I was a very capable chameleon.",
      "Looking back, one could say that an invisible life made me a really powerful client advocate. Since I could code switch so easily, it wasn't hard to build technology inclusive of wider abilities or different cultural norms. I could see the unseen and push companies to build for them, and we really did design better products. This all came at the cost of muting parts of myself, however, and I had to ask myself, 'What was the real price for all this good work?'",
      "I lived and worked in Japan for nearly a decade and was treated, quite openly, like a foreigner. All the other foreigners got the same treatment too. It didn't take me long to realize that this was how I'm treated at home; with suspicion and mistrust, quizzical looks and resigned head shakes. It was somewhat tolerable while living abroad because my race and gender wasn't the focus (being a foreigner was), but I knew something would have to be different when I returned home to America in 2018. What I didn't know is who I was bringing back home with me.",
      "Looking around cautiously, I searched for models of what a Black woman could be in this world to address that need for change. I wanted so badly to emerge from the armor I had built around myself, but I wondered what that would even look like. Most people look at celebrities or people in the media for that validation, and when I looked, I saw women like Kerry Washington and Viola Davis and wondered if I needed to start dressing better or wear stilettos. I saw Mellody Hobson and Vernā Myers and wondered if I needed to be better at business. While stars are an ideal in their own right, they don't always reflect the average individual walking down the street.",

Becoming visible was no simple matter of just announcing myself to the world. Not after a lifetime of believing that my skin, my hair, my body, and my voice were all sources of discomfort for the dominant culture. Did it matter that I had a doctorate, was multilingual, cultured, and experienced, if I didn't look the part? We need to find self-affirmation everywhere we go to play the part with confidence.",

In short, a bushman captures a baboon by hiding melon seeds in a tiny hole he's drilled into an ant heap. Curiosity overcomes the baboon and he sticks his hand in the hole and grabs the seeds, trapping himself with his own fist and stubbornness. 'If he were smart, he would just let go,' the narrator says. But instead, he is captured and fed copious amounts of salt, so rare that he gorges himself and is soon weary with thirst. The bushman then releases the baboon and follows him to an underground spring, where they both drink.",
      "In Chappelle's life, the seeds that trapped him were promises of money and fame. And he was smart enough to let go. For me, the analogy is about how a seemingly mutually beneficial arrangement is in reality transactional and manipulative. The creature is made into a tool, seen as a means to an end and useful only insofar as it can give the human what he wants — what the human is incapable of finding for himself. Yes, you could say the baboon was unharmed, but his very nature was used against him. He was made to thirst, and then made to share his resources with his captor. His value and everything that happens to him is driven by someone else's thirst.",
      "As a Black, disabled woman in tech, it's no exaggeration to say that I am rarely seen as a being unto myself, with autonomy, choices, and a voice. Society sees me as a means to a diversity quota or a token minority colleague whose very presence threatens the white supremacy narrative. When I came back to the States and decided to be fully seen at last, I opened my fist and let go of the mistaken belief that there was only one way to be an acceptable or palatable Black woman. I let go of the idea in my mind that someone like Kerry Washington is the vision of perfection. I let go of the belief that there was only room for one Black woman at a time, and that I would just have to wait my turn.",

I am here to remind myself that my identity is not and does not need to be a neatly bound whole and there are varying layers of intersectionality; concentric circles woven with beautiful contradictions that all make up who I am as an African, an American, first generation immigrant, trans-racial adoptee. As a person living with a life-long disability, as a multicultural and multilingual person, and as so much more. I am here to remind myself that that is okay, and I have patterns of strong, complex women in my ancestry, in my kith and kin family with whom I can find resonance.",

      "At <a href='https://incluu.us/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>incluu, LLC</a>, we create brave spaces for life. To some, this concept may sound dreamy, ambitious, and a little '<a href='https://www.fastcompany.com/3046358/millennials-have-a-different-definition-of-diversity-and-inclusion' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>millennial</a>', but our work in the diversity, equity, and inclusion space at the intersection of human, tech, and civil rights has continued to expose the pitfalls organizations face when they do not fully embrace and commit to their DEI initiatives.",
      "The murder of George Floyd in May 2020 and the global Black Lives Matter protests that followed forced organizations to explore the concept of breaking down barriers in their peoples, practices, and products. In doing so, many sought and are seeking more fair and inclusive practices. For help in their DEI journey, they are turning to thought partners now more than ever.",
      "Volunteers, often many of whom are members of marginalized groups, progress DEI work. From within, these volunteers build grassroots movements and shoulder the lift and rise of DEI initiatives. We are now not only seeing <a href='https://ecornell.cornell.edu/diversity-and-inclusion' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>accredited programs</a> and <a href='https://stanfordexeced.stanford.edu/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>boot camps</a> popping up around DEI learning but also <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rise-chief-diversity-officer-russell-reynolds-associates/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>full-fledged positions and career paths</a> being built around this work.",
      "Resources to grow inclusivity and belonging internally and externally are increasing daily, and yet many individuals and organizations still struggle to progress this work. Our team at incluu has over twenty collective years of experience working on various diversity, equity, and inclusion projects for accessibility, product, education, and across tech spaces. From that experience, we've learned that an organization's failure to achieve and reach its full potential for real, sustainable transformative change stems from five factors.",
      "<strong>1. Inability to see DEI work as mission-critical for the organization's ecosystem</strong>",
      "Take this example: An organization has rallied to the call for more comprehensive changes by green-lighting the creation of a DEI committee, or perhaps a new <a href='https://www.greatplacetowork.com/resources/blog/what-is-an-employee-resource-group-erg-plus-benefits-and-how-to-start-one' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Employee Resource Group</a>. Hooray; this is a good first step as everything appears to be headed in the right direction and morale is high. Success is on the horizon, and yet they face these roadblocks: DEI work competes with their core work responsibilities; impact is being used cosmetically for positive public relations; accomplishments are not receiving air time at the company all-hands meetings or within company-wide reports; the DEI strategy is not being discussed by and with executive leadership.",
      "These are all signs the organization does not see the work as essential to its entire ecosystem; its people, practices, and products. Work completed in one area of the ecosystem directly affects and influences the other parts as well. If, for example, an organization is looking to change its design-thinking practices to include an accessibility checklist, this also requires the organization to train its people to design more inclusively, which then trickles into what goes into the organization's product. Every facet of the organization's practices and procedures must face scrutiny and no area can remain untouched.",
      "The non-holistic approach typically leads to <a href='https://hbr.org/2019/04/the-costs-of-codeswitching' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>unsuccessful one-off efforts in various areas such as hiring, compensation, and workplace inclusivity</a>, to name a few. Lack of intentionality by leadership in structuring the foundation of how DEI blends into the entire organization is something that organizations can tackle and overcome. However, it relies on understanding that the work done toward making an organization more diverse and inclusive is a catalyst for change throughout the organization.",
      "<strong>2. Lack of individual & strategy empowerment</strong>",
      "Too often organizations default to hiring an internal DEI consultant before setting intentional, organization-backed DEI goals. We see high levels of energy and passion when their DEI work begins, but then things come to a halt or the progression is slower than the demand feeding it. This is a symptom of the directly responsible individual(s) feeling unempowered to act or achieve strategies.",
      "Implementing a carefully crafted three-year strategy can fall short because of a lack of: executive sponsorship (through being engaged, supportive, and highlighting initiatives); budget & resource allocations; ability to roll out changes across organizational business units; redundancy (if this person is out-of-the-office (OOO), who will pick up the torch?); capacity (If the individual is already working 100% on their core work, how can they meaningfully contribute to DEI initiatives?).",
      "Many DEI advocates begin with a solid strategy, but efforts fall flat because there isn't enough supportive backing to implement the suggested changes. For hired DEI leaders, this is problematic, but for a volunteer, the lack of support can be morale-crushing. A volunteer's struggle to maintain momentum when they are working at overcapacity (<a href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2021/03/14/is-diversity-work-emotional-labor/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>10-20% on top of their day job</a>) for these critical organizational efforts can be difficult, emotional, and heavy.",
      "Companies like <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>LinkedIn</a>, <a href='https://twitter.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Twitter</a>, and <a href='https://justworks.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Justworks</a> have recently taken bold and brave steps to ensure they support those doing the work to move initiatives forward. That support comes in acknowledgment through compensating them for their invaluable contributions to the success of the organization and its commitments. Across all industries, organizations are budgeting annually for this work whether it's by denoting budgets to their ERGs or to an overall program.",
      "When organizations recognize, showcase, and reward individuals and their efforts in making their peoples, products, and practices more inclusive and diverse, they are empowering their community members and also highlighting the overall importance of this work. There are many ways to implement reward/compensation systems for DEI work, so this is an area for organizations to embrace creatively.",
      "<strong>3. Pushback based on organization culture or policy</strong>",
      "People working in Silicon Valley or in tech jobs are well-aware of the overemphasis on 'culture' or 'policies.' Companies such as <a href='https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-fallout' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Basecamp and Coinbase recently moved forward to ban social and political discussions at work</a>, leading to the erosion of employee faith in the companies in question. We also see older policies backfire when they reach into areas like physical appearances, such as with <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/us/politics/the-crown-act.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>policies discriminating against Black or textured hairstyles</a> in schools and places of work.",
      "Company culture and all company policies must be re-evaluated and changed based on the <a href='https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/global-and-cultural-effectiveness/pages/authentic-leadership-requires-taking-action.aspx' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>legitimate calls for action</a> when they arise. If an organization refuses to do better by making more inclusive changes to its culture and policy, it rewards and lends credence to the toxic behaviors DEI-advocates are working to dismantle.",
      "The world changes daily. Refusing to change with it by re-evaluating and implementing changes to the organization's peoples, practices, and products holds organizations back from growth and innovation. When heeding the call for more diverse, fair, and inclusive practices and receiving recommendations from those engaged in the work, leadership cannot claim to be doing the work by choosing to focus only on the most comfortable items and ignoring the rest.",
      "<strong>4. The assumption that transformative change can happen 'good, fast, and cheap'</strong>",
      "The rise in interest and commitments in the DEI space is promising, however, too many organizations assume that work can happen 'good, fast, and cheap.' The graphic below should be a familiar one. It applies to any service in which someone is investing. When an organization is looking for 'good, fast, and cheap,' they are searching for a fantasy. Diversity, equity, and inclusion work is: driven by people (both emotionally and capacity-wise); a long-term commitment (lasting the life-cycle of the organization); and dependent on dedicated budgets and resources.",
      "Of course, those looking for these types of services come to the discussion with assumptions, biases, and selective focus on how to make changes throughout their organization. In fact, at incluu's inception, we fielded requests for speaking engagements and onetime workshops. While companies seem committed to making their spaces more inclusive, looking back at their commitments, and through our own market research, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/06/09/corporate-diversity-equity-inclusion-spending/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>we see many are not progressing</a>.",
      "To be clear, starting small is good and necessary. However, decision-makers within the organization must understand that no matter where they are beginning in their DEI journey, there is no last station where folks can pat themselves on the back and say the work is done.",
      "<strong>5. Overemphasis on the quantifiable data over the experiential data</strong>",
      "Numbers come into play and question often whether it's in terms of budget or to measure impact. Data shows that more diverse and inclusive organizations <a href='https://hbr.org/2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>capture more market share</a>, and <a href='https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/why-diversity-matters' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>perform better financially</a>. While it's understandable that some organizations just learning to embrace DEI principles want to have the data to share with stakeholders or executive leadership, we find all too often it is the data they believe will solely convey that committing to diversity, equity, and inclusion work was and is a beneficial investment. This isn't always the case, and when working with our partners, we stress the importance of qualitative or experiential data received, as it is integral and often more valuable to achieving their overall goals.",
      "For example, incluu creates and conducts customized inclusion sentiment surveys, provides analyses, and crafts action plans geared towards an increase in positive inclusion sentiments with the data collected. While the change in metrics is beneficial for validation and tracking, we can see the real impact in the student and teacher dynamic which has now changed for the better because both parties share the same language for discussing gender expression. In addition, we may also observe increased colleague-to-colleague morale and productivity because the shared language allows for clearer conversations about accessibility issues in product offerings. Everyone can then work together to course-correct as needed and make better decisions.",
      "As when innovating new products, it is fundamental to listen to feedback directly from customers and customer support staff, and then track the experiential outcomes thriving in organizations because of a centered and strategic focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion.",
      "Organizations must maintain a holistic view of their DEI initiatives to better understand where they are on their journey. They must continue to plan, strategize, and implement diverse, equitable, and inclusive principles well into the future and be willing to reflect, review, and revise their strategies as necessary. People must ultimately resolve people-created challenges, after all.",

      "After years of this work, we've identified five common barriers that hold organizations back from achieving the transformative change they say they want. Organizations often approach DEI with the expectation that they can have fast, cheap, and high-quality outcomes. They want to check a box.",
      "The first barrier: treating DEI as a program rather than a practice. Organizations hire a diversity officer, launch a training, and consider the work done. But DEI is not a destination—it's an ongoing commitment that must be woven into every aspect of organizational culture.",
      "Second: lack of accountability at the leadership level. DEI initiatives without executive sponsorship and accountability are doomed to fail. Leaders must be willing to be held accountable for outcomes, not just intentions.",
      "Third: centering comfort over growth. Transformative change is uncomfortable. Organizations that prioritize the comfort of dominant group members over the growth required for equity will never achieve meaningful change.",
      "Fourth: insufficient investment. Meaningful DEI work requires resources—time, money, and personnel. Organizations that expect transformation on a shoestring budget are setting themselves up for failure.",
      "Fifth: lack of systemic thinking. Individual trainings and initiatives cannot transform systems. Organizations must be willing to examine and change their policies, practices, and structures.",

      "Helen Pluckrose, the founder of the site Counterweight*, has been outspoken in her critique of Critical Social Justice Theory (CSJ). In her article, <em>What do we Mean by Critical Social Justice</em>, published earlier this year, Pluckrose attempts to explain her opposition to Critical Social Justice.",
      "Both CSJ and Liberalism, she agrees, seek to achieve social justice. Liberalism, however, assumes that the starting point of 'truth' is objective and not culturally informed. Pluckrose therefore believes that everyone can attain the same level of understanding of 'objective truth' with sufficient critical thinking skills.",
      "This assertion is not supported by Critical Social Justice theory. CSJ questions the starting point of 'truth' and asks, whose truth: what is the positionality of the person claiming said truth, and further, what are the social structures affecting the power dynamics which then inform what becomes truth?",
      "In technology, claims of objectivity are particularly seductive and particularly dangerous. Algorithms are often presented as neutral and objective, when in reality they encode the biases of their creators and the inequities present in their training data.",
      "The goal is not to abandon the pursuit of truth, but to recognize that truth-seeking is always a human endeavor, shaped by human perspectives and serving human purposes. When we acknowledge this, we can begin to ask: Whose truth? Truth in service of what?",

      "I am passionate about my work as a Product Inclusion Specialist, a profession where I build products that work for everyone, applying equitable or merely transactional profit practices, because growth in the money of equal inclusion not company progress.",
      "My work is not an accident—it is the culmination of a lifetime of experiences navigating systems that were not designed for people like me. From being the only Black student in advanced classes to being one of few Black women in tech.",
      "The journey from invisibility to empathy began with seeing myself reflected in others' struggles. Understanding that my experiences of marginalization connected me to others facing different but related forms of exclusion.",
      "Radical empathy goes beyond sympathy or even standard empathy. It requires us to decenter ourselves, to sit with discomfort, to truly listen to experiences different from our own without defensiveness or the urge to fix.",
      "In tech, radical empathy means designing with, not for. It means including affected communities throughout the development process, not just as an afterthought. It means being willing to fundamentally change course when we learn our products cause harm.",
      "My work with Incluu and with our partners is rooted in this radical empathy—a belief that we can build technologies that advance human flourishing for everyone, not just those who have historically been centered.",
